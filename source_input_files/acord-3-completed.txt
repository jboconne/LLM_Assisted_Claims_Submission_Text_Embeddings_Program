## REMARKS
Initial investigation indicates possible mechanical failure of crane hydraulic system. Crane had been inspected two weeks prior to incident with no issues noted. Construction site was properly permitted and cordoned off, but the crane boom extended beyond safety barriers when it collapsed. Immediate actions taken include securing the site, installing temporary structural supports, water shut-off to prevent further damage, and 24/7 security posted. Insurance carrier adjuster has been dispatched and is expected on site within 24 hours.
